# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
My goals for this project includes :
  1. Showing my understanding of my SQL knowledge
  2. Discovering my weak areas and then working on improving them during and after this project.
  3. I would also like to revisit this project in a future date and would potentially do better.
  4. Utilize the mentors to help guide my though process while working on the project

## Process
##### Determine how best to map the data, and how to import it into the database
##### Read the *starting with questions* file, decide on the columns or table would be needed to answer the questions.
##### Do some cleaning on the columns or table before then running my queries.
##### Note down potential QA that I could test for while exploring my data using queries

## Results

I discovered that the data could inform me about the purchase habits of individuals that used the site for various parts of the world. It could further inform me about the spending pattenr of the visitors of the website and can potentially influence future marketing or business decision making

## Challenges 

1. I was not sure about the information about some columns, because I was not clear on the information that the columns held, I was hesitant to analyze the data in those tabs.
2. I struggled with making a decision and executing it
3. I did not realize how much difficult cleaning of the data was going to be, as the previous data i have worked with were majorly cleaned an relationships had been created.

## Future Goals

I would like to learn more about data normalization and also take some time to practice data cleaning and analyzation by myself using SQL as the project made me realize alot of areas that I am definitely still lacking in
